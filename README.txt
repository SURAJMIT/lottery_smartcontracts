REMIX lottery smart contract(by suraj shuban)
this is a smart contract that basically chooses winner of lottery and basically transfers the prize pool to winner by randomly choosing one, who is given entry for about 0.000001 ETH.
This repo has its script .sol as lottery.sol to navigate its directory.

This workspace contains 3 directories:

1. 'contracts': Holds three contracts with increasing levels of complexity.
2. 'scripts': Contains four typescript files to deploy a contract. It is explained below.
3. 'tests': Contains one Solidity test file for 'Ballot' contract & one JS test file for 'Storage' contract.

SCRIPTS

The 'scripts' folder has four typescript files which help to deploy the 'Storage' contract using 'web3.js' and 'ethers.js' libraries.
For the deployment of any other contract, just update the contract's name from 'Storage' to the desired contract and provide constructor arguments accordingly 
in the file `deploy_with_ethers.ts` or  `deploy_with_web3.ts`

In the 'tests' folder there is a script containing Mocha-Chai unit tests for 'Storage' contract.

To run a script, right click on file name in the file explorer and click 'Run'. Remember, Solidity file must already be compiled.
Output from script will appear in remix terminal.

Please note, require/import is supported in a limited manner for Remix supported modules.
For now, modules supported by Remix are ethers, web3, swarmgw, chai, multihashes, remix and hardhat only for hardhat.ethers object/plugin.
For unsupported modules, an error like this will be thrown: '<module_name> module require is not supported by Remix IDE' will be shown.

additional note:'this is fmy first ever smart contract".;)
